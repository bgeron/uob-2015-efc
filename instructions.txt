Make some files

- SSH to Wallace

- cd uob-2015-efc
- git pull

To preview:

- make
- Look in the _build/html directory

When you're sure of your changes:

- git add <new file 1> <new file 2>...
- git commit -am 'some descriptive message'
- make render
- make publish


If something fails, running git pull again might make it work.
