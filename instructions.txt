Make some files

- SSH to Wallace

- cd uob-2015-efc

- make fresh

To preview:

- make (or make preview)
- Look in the _build/html directory

When you're sure of your changes:

- git add newfile1
- git commit -am 'some descriptive message'
- make render
- make publish


If something fails, running 'make fresh' again might make it work.
